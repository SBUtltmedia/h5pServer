I envision the app, with this structure, as having two modes: practice mode & assessment mode.

We are very happy with the assessment mode and we want to modify truth-table10.html to add  practice mode. 

In practice mode, when the user clicks Submit, they either get a message (call it “Yay!) telling them everything is correct, 
or the incorrect truth-value assignments in the table are displayed in red, with the cells illuminated (the current problem number 
remains active). This gives the user a chance to reflect on what they have gotten wrong and why. The user can then toggle the 
highlighted wrong values to the correct ones, reclick on Submit. The next button then becomes active (without “Yay”).  
In practice mode, no record is kept of attempts. But a score is delivered at the end corresponding to the students having completed 
the exercise.

Modes should be determing by a "&" which will need to be parsed by the game html itself. At this point, we want no changes to the 
overall SBUFramer architecture. 


Throughout the lifetime of the user's experiecne of the game they will need to go between two modes. ANd it would need to behave
differently, based on the mode=practice or assessment.
